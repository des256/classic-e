# E

After rummaging through several Rust projects on the Internet, trying to
convince myself that I shouldn't do it all over again, I found nothing too
helpful, or up to similar standards as my old trusty 25-year old... E.

It's essentially the discipline of the old days with the possibilities of
the new:

```
base - Basic functionality, various math concepts, vectors, pixel formats,
       etc.

platform - Access to platform-specific features, like files, sockets, thread
           pools, windowing, etc.

gpu - Access to GPU for graphics and compute resources.

image - Image formats and loaders/savers.

scene - Roughly GLTF-compliant scene graph library.

ui - User interface components.

net - Access to various networking protocols.
```
