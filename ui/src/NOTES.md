# DEV NOTES

- Stacks and Grids don't have enough expressivity yet
- get icons from same texture resource, derive smaller textures from same texture resource in gpu part
    - SubTexture1D
    - SubTexture2D
    - SubTexture3D
- ScrollBar:
    - when scrollbars get too small, they need to auto-disable
    - scrollbar tabs should have a minimum size
- add various types of padding to all widgets
    - Book
    - Button
    - Field
    - Grid
    - Menu
    - MenuBar
    - Progress
    - Slider
    - Stack
    - Toggle
    - ToolBar
- add different mouse cursors updated by mousemove
    - first tier: global function in UI to set cursor, according to a growing enum
    - arrow (IDC_ARROW, XC_arrow)
    - vertical arrow (IDC_UPARROW, XC_center_ptr)
    - hourglass (IDC_WAIT, XC_watch)
    - crosshairs (IDC_CROSS, XC_crosshair)
    - finger (IDC_HAND, XC_hand1)
    - open hand (?, ?)
    - grabbing hand (?, ?)
    - magnifying glass (?, ?)
    - caret (IDC_IBEAM)
    - slashed circle (IDC_NO, ?)
    - scale arrows cross (IDC_SIZEALL, XC_fleur)
    - scale arrows UL <-> DR (IDC_SIZENESW, ?)
    - scale arrows UR <-> DL (IDC_SIZENWSE, ?)
    - scale arrows L <-> R (IDC_SIZEWE, XC_sb_h_double_arrow)
    - scale arrows U <-> D (IDC_SIZENS, XC_sb_v_double_arrow)
- there are various instances where some default text is measured to estimate the size of a widget, this might not be appropriate
- taking Cell for everything might not be entirely necessary, play around with mutability
- use struct enums instead of tuple enums
- document all the code
- rustdoc
- basic examples
- simplify the mouse/capturing code
- timers
- separate UI resources from draw context
- design how buttons and menus trigger actions, action trait or closure
- Win32 implementation
- explore Cocoa/Metal
- explore web/WebGL, WASM interface; popup menus by divs over the canvas?
- potentially improve the graphics commands, update OpenGL API towards Vulkan?
- put constant dimensions in widget styles instead
- Stack = 1D Grid; merge the two

## STILL TODO

- MenuBar and Menu
- in-menu toggles
- pickers: color, date, file, time
- messagebox
- Grid
- List and Tree
- Scroller
- ToolTip
- actions with menus and toolbars
