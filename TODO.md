- zoomable/pannable frame tree idea
- all widgets have their own draw call
- texture loading from file

# FOR LATER

- multiple window support in UI (syncing glXSwapBuffers seems to be difficult)
- setup sensible glXSwapInterval for each window

# INCOMING

- ColorParameter as_u32 and as_vec4 instead of into


# OTHER WIDGETS

- Accordeon
- Breadcrumb
- Carousel
- DatePicker
