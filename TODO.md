# PRIORITY

- texture loading from file

# FOR LATER

- remove texture atlas and dependency
- revise uber shader after removing texture atlas stuff
- Vec<UIRect>::push_image
- zoomable/pannable frame tree idea
- multiple window support in UI (syncing glXSwapBuffers seems to be difficult)
- setup sensible glXSwapInterval for each window
