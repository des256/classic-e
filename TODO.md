# PRIORITY

- zoomable/pannable frame tree idea
- texture loading from file

# FOR LATER

- multiple window support in UI (syncing glXSwapBuffers seems to be difficult)
- setup sensible glXSwapInterval for each window

# OTHER WIDGETS

- Accordeon
- Breadcrumb
- Carousel
- DatePicker
- FilePicker
- MessageBox
- Pagination
- Splitter
- TimePicker
- Tree
